# Basic Interview Problems and their Solutions


This repository is the implementation of basic data structures and various  basic coding problems which were asked in interviews or asked in HackerRank problems.

Specifically I have used Python, C++ and Java in order to solve the problems.

The problems I have implemented here are asked from me in my interviews. That's why I think it would be more easy for you guys to go through these problems so you
too can exceed in your interviews.
